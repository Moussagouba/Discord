This Discord bot is designed to provide email verification for users when they join your server. Upon joining, users will receive a verification email containing a link that they need to click in order to verify their email address.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
discord.py library (pip install discord.py)
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the discord.py file and replace the following placeholders with your actual information:

"YOUR_EMAIL": Your email address (for sending verification emails).
"YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD": Your email password (for sending verification emails).
"YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN": Your bot's Discord token.
Run the bot using the following command:

Copy code
python bot.py
How it Works
When a user joins the Discord server, the on_member_join event triggers.
The bot generates a unique verification token and sends a verification email to the user's provided email address.
The email contains a link to the verification endpoint (http://yourbotdomain.com/verify) with the user's ID and token.
The user clicks the link, and the verification endpoint processes the request.
If the token matches the stored token, the user's email is considered verified.
Customization
You can customize the content of the verification email by modifying the send_verification_email function in the bot.py file.
Implement the verification endpoint (http://yourbotdomain.com/verify) using a web framework like Flask.
Security Considerations
Ensure that you keep your email credentials ("YOUR_EMAIL" and "YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD") secure. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.
Implement proper error handling and token storage to enhance security and reliability.
